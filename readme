Slept is a sleep tracker.

When called without arguments it displays sleep logs in console in a 
graphical form with each line representing a day's sleep. It should fill
the terminal completely. Example:

DATE	Sleep scaled to width. Start and endpoints are at noon   x/12 hours
       ________________________________________________________    slept
      |                                                        |

03-21:           X^XXXXXXXXXXXXX*                ^             |========    
03-22:            ^     XXXXXXXX*XX              ^             |=====     
03-23:           X^XXXXXXXXXXXXX*XXXXXXX         ^             |==========  

This example uses X and = where colored blocks should be used. The * and ^
markers represent midnight and 6:00 (am and pm) respectively.

Slept should be able to scroll the log using cursor/vim(jk) keys.

To add new entries to slept it should accept several types of input.

For normal use:
	slept 15:00-5:30 10:20-6:00
indicates sleep from 3-5:30 and 10:20 to 6 on the previous day's date.

Dates may also be specified for entering older data. The date should be the
first argument:
	slept 3-20 3:00-5:00
Slept should error for future dates.

Prior entries can be amended. Old times are completely replaced:
	slept -a 3-20 3:00-6:30
